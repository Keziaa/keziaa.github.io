Hey, I’m Kezia (key-zee-ah)! I’m a non-binary (they/them) game developer. I’m a gameplay/generalist programmer who specializes in the Unity engine. I was one of the primary programmers on Cuphead and I worked on a large portion of its DLC. I also contributed on other indie games such as We Are OFK and Moonglow Bay. I also help organize Dirty Rectangles Toronto which is known for their monthly Show & Chills. I was also selected for Forbes 30 under 30 2020 in Games.

I enjoy video games that push the boundary of the medium and mess with the player’s expectations. I often aim for surrealism and dreamlike qualities in the content I make. 

These days I'm taking on freelance work as well as developing my own game Revertices.

I live in Toronto, Ontario with my cat Yuffie.
