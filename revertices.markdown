Revertices is a 2D sidescrolling action combat game where you must choose one of three friends to save in a ruined world. The chosen character must face the corrupted remains of their two beloved friends. I take on the role as creative director, lead programmer, lead artist and lead designer.
Revertices is currently mid-development.
