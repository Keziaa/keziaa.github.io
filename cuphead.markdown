For the past four years I have been working at StudioMDHR developing Cuphead and its DLC. 

I programmed full boss and platforming levels. I seamlessly implemented art assets and animations in the Unity engine with meticulous detail. I created Unity editor tools for smooth workflow. I was the primary audio programmer and I worked closely with the sound team to implement audio to their specifications.

Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course will be released in 2020.
