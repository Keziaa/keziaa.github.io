Map Game was created for DMG's Textile Game Controllers Jam. I decided to make a game that could be played solely on the Adafruit Circuit Playground. I used textiles to create a map that the player can interact with to fight monsters and gain health.

Map Game was fully programmed and sewn together by me.
